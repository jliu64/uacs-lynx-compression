This directory contains several drivers that operate using the taint library. Most of them are iterations of the bytecode extraction tool. This README pertains to that tool.

To generate a dot file of the extracted bytecode, please do the following:
1) Set up the environment using the setup.sh script in the directory above this one like so:
      source setup.sh
2) Take a trace of the interpreter running the input program of interest. See the REAME in the tracer directory on how to do that.
3) Run the extract program in this directory. It minimally requires:
      ./extract -t <trace> -s <source> 
          <trace> - the trace file to extract from
          <source> - the NAME of the interpreted program. For example, if you ran factorial.py, specify that and not a path to factorial.py.

   There are a few additional options that can provide additional precision. These options include:
        -d <addr list> - This option allows the user to specify a list of addresses that perform the dispatch. For example, the implementation of python installed on this machine (onyx) always dispatches at 523cb5.
        -b <mem list> - this operation allows the user to specify the location of the bytecode in memory. This is a list of memory locations of the form addr[size].


Example:
    Say I have a trace, trace.out, of a python run on the program factorial.py. I also know the dispatch location of python, so I'll provide that as well. I would therefore run:

    ./extract -t trace.out -s factorial.py -d 523cb5

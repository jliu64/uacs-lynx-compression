Self-Modifying code:
    Simple self-modifying
    Recursive
    Single buffer used multiple times

Recursive:
    Simple recursive program like fibonnaci
    Dynamic programming (memoization)

Multithreaded:
    Simple multithreaded programs in multiple languages.
        Ex: Go, C, Java

Native:
    C program written in native assembly.
        Can compare how CFG is structured compared to what we expect to see.

Inline vs. Traditional function:
    Have an inline function and an equivalent traditional function.
        Would expect CFG to be the same for both?

Jump/goto
    Make Edsgar Djikstra roll over in his grave.

Obfuscation
    Run it through the MOVfuscator and then create the CFG.
    Try other obfuscation tools?
